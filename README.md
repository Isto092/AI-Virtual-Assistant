# AI Virtual Assistant

## Objective

To develop a secure, locally hosted AI virtual assistant capable of processing natural language queries, automating tasks, and delivering intelligent responses without internet dependency, leveraging offline speech recognition, optimized local inference, and robust data privacy measures.

### Skills Learned

- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Offline Speech Recognition
- AI Model Optimization & Deployment
- System Security & Data Privacy
- Self-hosted Application Development

### Tools Used

- Whisper AI – For offline speech-to-text (voice command functionality).
- Llama 2 – As the core language model for natural language processing.
- Python – For scripting, integrating components, and building the assistant logic.
- Linux OS / Terminal – For development and deployment of the self-hosted assistant.
- Encryption Libraries (OpenSSL) – For securing stored data.
- Local Storage Solutions (SQLite, JSON files) - For managing data securely without external transmission.
- Speech Recognition & Audio Processing Libraries (ffmpeg) - To handle microphone input and audio conversion.
- Cloudflare – For securing local network access, managing DNS, and adding an extra layer of protection for any local web interface or API endpoints.
