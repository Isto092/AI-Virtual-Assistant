# AI Virtual Assistant

## Objective

To develop a secure, locally hosted AI virtual assistant capable of processing natural language queries, automating tasks, and delivering intelligent responses without internet dependency, leveraging offline speech recognition, optimized local inference, and robust data privacy measures.

### Skills Learned

- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
- Offline Speech Recognition
- AI Model Optimization & Deployment
- System Security & Data Privacy
- Self-hosted Application Development

### Tools Used

- Whisper AI – For offline speech-to-text (voice command functionality).
- Llama 2 – As the core language model for natural language processing.
- Python – For scripting, integrating components, and building the assistant logic.
- Linux OS / Terminal – For development and deployment of the self-hosted assistant.
- Encryption Libraries (OpenSSL) – For securing stored data.
- Local Storage Solutions (SQLite, JSON files) - For managing data securely without external transmission.
- Speech Recognition & Audio Processing Libraries (ffmpeg) - To handle microphone input and audio conversion.
- Cloudflare – For securing local network access, managing DNS, and adding an extra layer of protection for any local web interface or API endpoints.

## Steps

Environment Setup:
- Installed necessary software and tools, including Python, Whisper AI and Llama 2 to create a suitable development environment.
 
Language Model Deployment:
- Deployed the Llama 2 language model locally and optimize performance for efficient natural language processing.

Speech-to-Text Integration: 
- Configured Whisper AI for offline speech recognition, enabling the assistant to process voice commands without relying on cloud services. 

Security Implementation: 
- Implemented encryption protocols and local data storage solutions to ensure user data privacy and prevent external data transmission. 

Cloudflare Configuration: 
- Set up Cloudflare services to manage DNS, enhance network security, and provide secure access to any local web interfaces or APIs associated with the assistant. 

System Testing and Validation:
- Conducted comprehensive testing to validate the assistant's functionality, ensuring accurate speech recognition, appropriate responses, and robust security measures.
